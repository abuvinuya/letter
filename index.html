      Dear Christine,<br><br>
      I never had the courage to say this out loud... but I'm into you.
      The way you worship God with all your heart reflects a deep, 
      genuine love that shines through your voice, 
      and the way you sing, pouring your heart into every note, 
      and inspires those who listen. 
      You have a natural beauty that caught my attention. 
      I will wait for you...even if it takes a year.
